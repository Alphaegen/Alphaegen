# Hello, everyone!

Highly motivated backend developer working at Suite Seven. I have been working with Magento 2 and Laravel for multiple years and I'm constantly trying to improve my skills. My current focus is on an ecommerce platform called Shopware.

I try to write clean and well documented code and make sure it isn't overly complicated.

I have experience in cloud technologies, continuous integration/deployment, web system architecture and Linux as a whole thanks to having used Manjaro as my main OS for 3 years.
